Write examples for three kinds of nova api extension:
    * Resource extension: which creates a new resource, actually a collection of object.
    * Controller extension: which extends existing resource.
    * Child resource extension: which create a new resource. The resource is child of another parent resource.

These examples contain rich document for learning.

Also how to curl these extension APIs are documented. These are very useful.
